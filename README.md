# Engineer Candidate Take-Home Assessment

## Purpose

The purpose of this assessment is to validate that the candidate can:

* Write clear, comprehensible, and extensible code
* Design and implement Data Models
* Demonstrate an understanding of Python, Django, and RESTful APIs
* Communicate clearly about design and architecture decisions

## Project Prompt

One of the capabilites of the Embold platform is to help our users find the best providers. 
In order to help another growing market with similar needs, we've decided
to build a platform for users to find all the best dogs out there. 

You've been tasked with starting the development of Embold's new Dogfinder API.
Upon first release, the API is expected to have three main capabilites.
* Returning the location (in latitude and longitude) and details of all dogs, or of just one dog by it's ID.
    * What details about a dog to include is up to your discretion, an example of some to include would be `name` and `breed`.
* Returning the location (in latitude and longitude) and details of all registered dog parks
* Submit a new location for a dog, so that we can keep all of our dog data up to date.

If time permits, we'd like one extra feature: 
* Return a list of all dogs inside a given radius from a given latitude, longitude point. 

This assessment should take approximately 4 hours, but feel free to spend more or less time on it.

## Project Deliverables

### Hard Requirements
* Use Python and Django
* The API must accept and return JSON

Create a repository on GitHub for your code and share the link with us.  
(If the Repo is private, share it with 'ebarajas')

In the repository, include the following:
* A file explaining any decisions you had to make or challenges you overcame.
* Brief API documentation describing how to use the APIs you've created.

## Bonus Points

We would love to see:

* Git history
* Production-quality code
